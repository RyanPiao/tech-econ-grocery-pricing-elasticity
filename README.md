# Tech-Econ Research Lab: Algorithmic Pricing and Demand Elasticity in App-Based Grocery Delivery

This repository documents a reproducible applied-econometrics workflow for studying demand response to delivered-price changes in app-based grocery delivery.

## Research question
How does customer demand respond to changes in **effective delivered price** (delivery/service/surge fees and discounts) in the short run and medium run?

## Week 1 (completed baseline)
- Day 1 framing + review: `DAY1_problem_framing.md`, `DAY1_review.md`
- Day 2-7 baseline artifacts (identification lock, synthetic panel, EDA, baseline model, robustness, recap)

## Week 2 continuation (Day 2-Day 7, production-style extension)

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Week 1 baseline panel + outputs
python scripts/day2_generate_synthetic_data.py --n-sessions 60000 --seed 20260303
python scripts/day3_day5_pipeline.py

# Week 2 continuation end-to-end

```

## Interpretation boundary

This run uses a synthetic, reproducible mock panel for workflow validation. Coefficients in this repository should be treated as methodological artifacts, not production business estimates.

Causal claims require the credibility-gate checks defined in `docs/day2_preanalysis_lock.md` to pass on real data.
